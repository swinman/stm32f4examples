@par Example Description

This Demo presents the implementation of a device firmware upgrade (DFU) capability
in the STM32F2xx, STM32F4xx and STM32F105/7 devices.
It follows the DFU class specification defined by the USB Implementers Forum for
reprogramming an application through USB-FS-Device.
The DFU principle is particularly well suited to USB-FS-Device applications that
need to be reprogrammed in the field.

To have an example of how to generate a DFU image, please refer to the project
provided in folder "binary_template". This project allows to generate a binary
image (*.bin file) that can be used to generate a *.dfu image using the tool
provided by ST: "DFUse\DFU File Manager" available for download from www.st.com

Once the *.dfu image is generated, it can be downloaded into internal flash memory
using the ST tool "DFUse\DFUse Demonstration" or the tool "DFUse\STDFU Tester" both
available for download from www.st.com


The supported memories for this example are:
 - Internal Flash memory for STM32F2xx, STM32F4xx and STM32F105/7 devices
 - OTP memory for STM32F2xx and STM32F4xx devices.

To add a new memory interface you can use the template memory interface provided
in folder \Libraries\STM32_USB_Device_Library\Class\dfu.

@note After each device reset, hold down the Key user-button on the STM32F4DISCOVERY boards

This example works
  - in full speed (FS) when the STM32F4DISCOVERY board and the USB OTG FS peripheral are used

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example has been tested with the following environments:
    - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
    - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
    - STM32F4DIS-LCD for the LCD module
    - A USB type A (Male) to Micro AB (Male) cable
    - DfuSe_Demo_V3.0.2(The software is located in the folder:\Utilities\PC_Software\DfuSe_Demo_V3.0.2)

  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60

  - Hardware Set-up
    - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
    - Mount STM32F4DIS-LCD module onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON3
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A (Male) to Micro AB (Male)'
      cable through USB connector CN5
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board

@par How to use it ?

  In order to load the Project code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)


   - MDK-ARM
      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)



@note Known Limitations
      - This example retargets the C library printf() function to the EVAL board LCD
        screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
        messages.As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be
        displayed on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in
        bottom of the LCD).
