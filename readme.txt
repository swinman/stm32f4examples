@par Example Description

This example provides a description of how to use the USB OTG host peripheral
on the STM32F2xx, STM32F4xx and STM32F105/7 devices.

When an USB Device is attached to the Host port, the device is enumerated and checked
whether it can support HID device or not, if the attached device is HID one, when the user
press the User Button, the mouse or the keyboard application is launched.

Moving the mouse will move the pointer in the display rectangle and if User Button is pressed,
the corresponding rectangle will be highlighted in green
If a keyboard has been attached, the display show the following messages and the taped
characters are displayed in green on the display.

This example works:
  - in full speed (FS) when the STM32F4DISCOVERY board and the USB OTG FS peripheral are used

@note In the USB Host HID class, two layouts are defined in the Project_keybd.h file
      and could be used (Azerty and Querty)
        //#define QWERTY_KEYBOARD
        #define AZERTY_KEYBOARD
      The User can eventually add his own layout by editing the HID_KEYBRD_Key array
      in the Project_keybd.c file


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example has been tested with the following environments:
     - STM32F4DISCOVERY board
     - STM32F4DIS-BB for the Base Board
     - STM32F4DIS-LCD for the LCD module
     - A USB type A (Female) to Micro AB (Male)
     - A mouse or A Keyboard

  - Software development tools
    - EWARM V6.40
    - MDK-ARM V4.60

  - Hardware Set-up
    - Mount STM32F4DISCOVERY board onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON1 and CON2
    - Mount STM32F4DIS-LCD module onto STM32F4DIS-BB board through CON3
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a mouse(or Keyboard) with a 'USB type
      A (Female) to Micro AB (Male)' cable through USB connector CN5
    - Connect the STM32F4DISCOVERY board to a PC with a 'USB type A to Mini-B' cable
      through USB connector CN1 to power the board

@par How to use it ?
  In order to load the Project code, you have do the following:
   - EWARM
      - Open the Project.eww workspace
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
      - Load project image: Project->Debug
      - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)


   - MDK-ARM
      - Open the Project.uvproj project
      - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all target files
      - Load project image: Debug->Start/Stop Debug Session
      - Run program: Debug->Run (F5)


@note Known Limitations
      - This example retargets the C library printf() function to the EVAL board LCD
        screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
        messages.As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be
        displayed on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in
        bottom of the LCD).
