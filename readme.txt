@par Example Description
  This firmware example shows the benefit brought by the STM32F4 floating-point
  units (FPU).

  The WAKUP button switches from automatic mode (continuous zoom in and out) to
  manual mode.
  In manual mode, the KEY button is used to launch another calculation.

  Two workspaces are available to activate or not the FPU during
  the compilation phase.

@note For more information on how to use floating-point units (FPU)
      with STM32F405/07xx and STM32F415/417xx microcontrollers refer to AN4044 :
      "Using floating-point unit (FPU) with STM32F405/07xx
      and STM32F415/417xx microcontrollers"

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F4xx Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM324xG-EVAL
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported
    device and development board.


@par How to use it?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Select STM32F4xG_Julia_FPU or STM32F4xG_Julia_NoFPU workspace
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
